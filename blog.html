      <p class="post-meta">Category: <a href="/articles/taxation">Taxation & Social Justice</a> | Date: May 9, 2025</p>

      <div class="post-content">
        <p>Your Excellency,</p>

        <p>I write with deep concern as a citizen who shares in your government’s vision for prosperity, inclusiveness, and the upliftment of every Ghanaian, especially those at the base of the economic ladder. I respectfully draw your attention to the current income tax threshold and its harsh impact on very low-income earners.</p>

        <p>Currently, under Ghana’s income tax regime, only the first <strong>GH₵490</strong> of monthly income is exempt from taxation. Earnings above this amount, even as little as GH₵500, are taxed. This system, while administratively straightforward, does not reflect the lived realities of Ghanaians earning around GH₵1,000 or less per month. The cost of basic necessities—rent, transport, healthcare, food, education, and even minor support to family—cannot be sustainably met with such limited income, let alone allow for any meaningful savings or capital formation for future advancement.</p>

        <p>In fact, taxing such meager earnings is not only economically counterproductive but also morally concerning. These are individuals already surviving on the margins, whose contributions to the national economy through indirect taxes (VAT and levies on everyday goods and services) are already substantial. Every Ghanaian, regardless of income bracket, contributes to the tax base through consumption. It is therefore regressive to further burden those who earn the least through direct taxation.</p>

        <h3>Proposal</h3>
        <p>I humbly propose that the tax-exempt threshold be increased from <strong>GH₵490</strong> to at least <strong>GH₵1,500</strong> per month. This adjustment will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reflect a more realistic cost of living in urban and rural Ghana alike.</li>
          <li>Offer some breathing space for low-income earners to save, invest, or start micro-enterprises.</li>
          <li>Empower citizens at the grassroots to contribute more meaningfully to national development.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Alternative Revenue Solutions</h3>
        <p>Rather than overburdening the most vulnerable, I propose the following avenues for sustainable government revenue:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Encourage public institutions to operate with income-generating models rather than being purely cost centers.</li>
          <li>Invest in digitalization and plug tax leakages in customs, property tax collection, and commercial licensing.</li>
          <li>Explore public-private partnerships in transportation, agriculture, and energy sectors.</li>
          <li>Reduce unnecessary government expenditure and redirect saved funds into productive development efforts.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Your Excellency, taxation should not be a tool that entrenches poverty but rather a policy instrument that lifts people out of it. If we truly aim to build an equitable and prosperous Ghana, we must reset our tax policies to reflect compassion, pragmatism, and long-term national growth.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your attention, and I remain hopeful that this humble petition will receive your kind consideration.</p>

        <p>Yours respectfully,</p>
        <p><strong>[Your Full Name]</strong><br/>
